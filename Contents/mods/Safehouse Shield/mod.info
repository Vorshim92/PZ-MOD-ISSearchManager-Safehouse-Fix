description=This mod fixes a well-known bug in Project Zomboid that allows players to exploit the "Search Mode" feature to steal items from safehouses they don't have access to. Previously, if a player left items near the edge of their safehouse, unauthorized players could still interact with and loot them by triggering an icon at the boundary. Safehouse Sentinel prevents the creation of these interaction icons in unauthorized areas, ensuring that items left near the borders of a safehouse remain safe from theft. A must-have mod for multiplayer servers looking to enhance safehouse security.
